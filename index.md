# About Me

I am an economics PhD student at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. I study applied microeconomics with research interests in labor, inequality, and market design. My work combines theory and data, with an emphasis on developing and testing models that provide informative new intuitions about human behavior, and understanding their normative implications.

# About Me

I am an economics PhD student at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. My research interests are broadly in applied microeconomics with specific interest in issues in market design and labor economics.

[Fostering Children](./pdfs/foster.pdf) ([slides](./pdfs/foster_slides.pdf))

 <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foster families constitute a crucial input into foster care services. In this paper, a household
choice model is built to examine why households choose to be foster parents. The model is
motivated by the inability of classical altruism models to explain important facts about foster
families and children. In the model, children are costly and foster families get value from
taking care of foster children through the human capital of the foster child. The model links
a household’s decision to foster to their own fertility and wage and makes predictions about
which households have the highest willingness to foster based on these factors. The model’s
predictions find strong support in the data through instrumental variable strategies and the
model is able to rationalize many of the motivating facts. A simple form of the model is
jointly estimated to more directly compare and quantify the mechanisms. Sending the price of
biological children to infinity induces four times more foster families while sending the time
cost of foster children to 0 induces 50% more families families. The model and data suggest
that foster children are not perfect substitutes for biological children. Alternative theories are
discussed in the context of the data and empirical results.

[Targeting Skills in Education Interventions](./pdfs/educ.pdf)

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
In this paper I explore optimal investments in basic and advanced skills in education interventions. I analyze two closely related and plausible models and show that the policy implications starkly differ between them. I apply my results to interpret the existing empirical evidence on education interventions. I show that my model suggests a “sufficient statistic” approach to guiding skill-targeting in education policy. I then develop a methodology to utilize this approach and apply it to mathematics (advanced skill) and self-esteem (basic skill) in the NLSY. The results show that the returns to skill likely reflect that the true state of the world is likely between the two stark viewpoints.

[Information Goods](./pdfs/info.pdf)

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
  I analyze a stylized model of information acquisition that treats each dimension of the state space as a distinct information good with a cost. I characterize when information sources are substittues and complements and show how adding costs provides new insights into how economic agents pick where they get information. I apply this model to a firm recruiting example to show how it produces new insights into information demand and the literature surrounding labor-replacing technology.

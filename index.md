# About Me

I am an economics PhD student at the Stanford Graduate School of Business. My research is generally in applied microeconomics where I utilize a mixture of causal inference, machine learning and optimization methods to answer unique research questions. I work on topics in labor, child welfare and families, education, and inequality. My job market paper focuses on understanding which foster children benefit most from placement with foster families relative to institutions and how that informs optimal foster care policy.

I am seeking full-time roles as a research scientist, data scientist or similar role in the Bay Area for 2022. I code in R, Python, and SQL, and I am currently learning Scala.

[Information and Risky Behavior: Model and Policy Implications for COVID-19](./pdfs/covid19-6-16-2020.pdf)

<details>
 <summary>Abstract</summary>
 This paper studies a contagion model where individuals can take risky or safe actions to study the effects of testing and fines on disease spread and welfare. Testing gives agents knowledge to better assess the costs of exposing themselves to a disease. Whether testing increases or decreases disease spread depends on the private costs of the disease. If the private costs are small enough, then testing individuals increases infection. If the private costs are large enough, then testing individuals decreases infection. Punishing individuals for exposing themselves and others to the disease while also providing testing can also increase disease spread. Welfare in the economy is also examined in a simplified version of the model. Policy implications for public health responses to pandemics are discussed along with an application to crime.

[Fostering Children](./pdfs/foster.pdf) ([slides](./pdfs/foster_slides.pdf)) ([non-technical summary](./pdfs/foster-non-tech.pdf))

 <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foster families constitute a crucial input into foster care services. In this paper, a household
choice model is built to examine why households choose to be foster parents. The model is
motivated by the inability of classical altruism models to explain important facts about foster
families and children. In the model, children are costly and foster families get value from
taking care of foster children through the human capital of the foster child. The model links
a household’s decision to foster to their own fertility and wage and makes predictions about
which households have the highest willingness to foster based on these factors. The model’s
predictions find strong support in the data through instrumental variable strategies and the
model is able to rationalize many of the motivating facts. A simple form of the model is
jointly estimated to more directly compare and quantify the mechanisms. Sending the price of
biological children to infinity induces four times more foster families while sending the time
cost of foster children to 0 induces 50% more families. The model and data suggest
that foster children are not perfect substitutes for biological children. Alternative theories are
discussed in the context of the data and empirical results.

[Skill Ladders](./pdfs/educ.pdf)

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
This paper presents a model of skills and derives properties of the optimal investment into educational skills. In the model students can acquire basic and advanced skills at a cost to a policymaker who is budget-constrained. The optimal policy is very sensitive to the structure of the returns to skill - even when advanced skills give unbounded marginal returns, it may be optimal to invest more in basic skills if skills represent a ``skill ladder''. These results offer new interpretations on the existing empirical evidence on education interventions. There is a single object that determines whether to invest more in basic or advanced skills and whether the skill ladder model applies. I develop a methodology to estimate the returns to skills and this object and apply it to mathematics (advanced skill) and self-esteem (basic skill) in the NLSY. The results show that the returns to skill reflect that the true state of the world is between the two stark viewpoints and that there is substantial racial heterogeneity in the returns to skills from the lens of the model, suggesting that there may be benefits to focusing more on basic skills in educational policy making and that optimal skill targeting may differ by race.

[Information Goods](./pdfs/info.pdf)

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The main goal of this paper is to understand how people will change their information acquisition strategies as information sources become more or less costly. To do this, I develop a model of information acquisition in the spirit of traditional consumer theory that treats information sources, which are distinct dimensions of the state space, as different consumption goods. A general form of the model shows that as information becomes more costly, people will demand less of it, and also characterizes when information sources are substitutes or complements. The models insights are extensively analyzed in two settings: determining the optimal firm recruiting strategy when considering technical and social skills, and determining the optimal way to evaluate students using testing and assessing creativity. Other insights into dating and media consumption are also discussed.

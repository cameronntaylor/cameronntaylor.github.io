[Fostering Children](./pdfs/foster.pdf) ([slides](./pdfs/foster_slides.pdf)) ([non-technical summary](./pdfs/foster-non-tech.pdf))

 <details>
   <summary>Abstract</summary>
  Foster families constitute a crucial input into foster care services. In this paper, a household
choice model is built to examine why households choose to be foster parents. The model is
motivated by the inability of classical altruism models to explain important facts about foster
families and children. In the model, children are costly and foster families get value from
taking care of foster children through the human capital of the foster child. The model links
a household’s decision to foster to their own fertility and wage and makes predictions about
which households have the highest willingness to foster based on these factors. The model’s
predictions find strong support in the data through instrumental variable strategies and the
model is able to rationalize many of the motivating facts. A simple form of the model is
jointly estimated to more directly compare and quantify the mechanisms. Sending the price of
biological children to infinity induces four times more foster families while sending the time
cost of foster children to 0 induces 50% more families. The model and data suggest
that foster children are not perfect substitutes for biological children. Alternative theories are
discussed in the context of the data and empirical results.

[Skill Ladders](./pdfs/educ.pdf)

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
This paper presents a model of skills and derives properties of the optimal investment into educational skills. In the model students can acquire basic and advanced skills at a cost to a policymaker who is budget-constrained. The optimal policy is very sensitive to the structure of the returns to skill - even when advanced skills give unbounded marginal returns, it may be optimal to invest more in basic skills if skills represent a ``skill ladder''. These results offer new interpretations on the existing empirical evidence on education interventions. There is a single object that determines whether to invest more in basic or advanced skills and whether the skill ladder model applies. I develop a methodology to estimate the returns to skills and this object and apply it to mathematics (advanced skill) and self-esteem (basic skill) in the NLSY. The results show that the returns to skill reflect that the true state of the world is between the two stark viewpoints and that there is substantial racial heterogeneity in the returns to skills from the lens of the model, suggesting that there may be benefits to focusing more on basic skills in educational policy making and that optimal skill targeting may differ by race.

[Information Goods](./pdfs/info.pdf)

<details>
  <summary>Abstract</summary>
The main goal of this paper is to understand how people will change their information acquisition strategies as information sources become more or less costly. To do this, I develop a model of information acquisition in the spirit of traditional consumer theory that treats information sources, which are distinct dimensions of the state space, as different consumption goods. A general form of the model shows that as information becomes more costly, people will demand less of it, and also characterizes when information sources are substitutes or complements. The models insights are extensively analyzed in two settings: determining the optimal firm recruiting strategy when considering technical and social skills, and determining the optimal way to evaluate students using testing and assessing creativity. Other insights into dating and media consumption are also discussed.

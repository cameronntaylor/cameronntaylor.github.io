Every year college football fans agonize over their bowl picks in [ESPN's College Football Bowl Mania](http://fantasy.espn.com/college-bowl-mania/2018/en/). This contest gives fans the chance to pick the winner _and_ assign confidence points to all of the 40 or so college football bowl games. Fans hone their predictions skills for college football in a very uncertain environment over a short period of time.

It is not hard to see why college football bowl games are tricky to pick. Some of these reasons include:

- Geographic Factors and Attendance: Bowls take place all over the country and teams rarely have true &quot;home games&quot;. This affects attendance (which affects game environment and noise) and weather. Attendance at bowl games can be [quite low](https://www.newsday.com/sports/college/college-football/college-football-bowl-game-attendance-2018-18-1.24180893).  For example, in the Frisco Bowl this year, attendance was 11,000. San Diego State had an average attendance of around 30,000 at all their games. Teams may also be affected by the weather. In the Pinstripe Bowl, Miami played in about 40F weather. In Miami at the time it was _75F_.

- Conference and Schedules: Teams play the majority of their games within their conference. Bowls are, by rule, always outside of conferences. Thus, teams do not have many &quot;common opponents&quot; â€“ teams they have both played - that give a better sense of how the teams might fare against each other.

- Depth Charts:[Key players sit out](https://sports.yahoo.com/college-football-players-sitting-bowl-games-2018-210123415.html). And it's generally hard to measure exactly how important any one player is to a team's success or victory.
